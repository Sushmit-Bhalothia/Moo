•	The new habitants of the locality find it difficult to select a reliable milkman who provides them with good quality dairy products
•	The problem of reliability of the seller persists in the seller and buyer relation
•	Issues in maintaining the daily record of the number of products purchased and their amount led to conflicts between buyers and sellers
•	Record kept is never two-way verified by the seller and the consumer
